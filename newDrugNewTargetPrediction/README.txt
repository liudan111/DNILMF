In this folder, one can test the prediction ability for new drug - new target pairs.

Two methods, DNILMF and NRLMF, were compared.


In sub-folder "DNILMF", one can run: source("demo_DNILMF_newDnewT.R") to see results.
In sub-folder "NRLMF", one can run: source("demo_NRLMF_newDnewT.R") to see results.

Herein, the NRLMF was coded in R based on the original code (https://github.com/stephenliu0423/PyDTI) but with a little difference.
