# DNILMF

The R codes were used to predict drug-target interactions (DTI) by the proposed dual-network integrated logistic matrix factorization [1].

How To Run:

(1) Install required packages.

(2) setwd("dir including source codes").

(3) source("demo_DNILMF.R")

These codes were tested on Windows 7, but should also work on Linux.

For any problem about these codes, please feel free to contact Dr. Ming Hao at: kevin.m.hao@gmail.com.
